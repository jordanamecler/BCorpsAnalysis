This creates a more fun, empathetic classroom culture where students are deeply engaged. Systemically, Classcraft addresses engagement by connecting real-life interventions with engagement data from existing content and platforms. The result is a positive impact on individuals and educational outcomes including school climate, social emotional learning, academic performance, and attendance.

The purpose of Ramborn is to combat the climate crisis while supporting local economies and communities by protecting the natural environment in and around Luxembourg and reviving the culture of cider making. The idea for the business came as three friends toured the UK, tasting local English ciders and sharing family stories of cider-making - known locally as “Viez”. From this, the three friends launched Ramborn, a contraction of the Rambo apple name and the city of Born where the cidery sits. Ramborn only uses fruits sourced from traditional meadow orchards to make its range of ciders and perries which are now exported to 12 markets worldwide, spreading the word of Luxembourg’s cider-making heritage far and wide. Ramborn has helped to protect and revive nearly 1 million m2 (954,679m to be exact) of richly biodiverse habitat, home to over 5,000 species. In the last two years, Ramborn’s work has removed 31,000 Kg net of CO2 from the atmosphere.

The loan serves as an entry point and naturally transitions into a longer-term credit building product. In the short term, Fig provides a socially responsible, credit building alternative to payday loans. In the long term, Fig helps improve consumers’ financial health by building their credit up so they can access affordable mainstream credit products. In this way, Fig offers Americans with bad credit a second chance to rebuild credit and regain access to traditional credit products.","September, 2017","Houston, Texas, United States",Service with Minor Environmental Footprint,www.figloans.com,88.2,13.5,11.8,21.6,2.8,34.9

Wijngoed en Zorghoeve de Reestlandhoeve v.o.f.,"De Reestlandhoeve is a Vineyard and Care Farm located in Balkbrug (NL). In the Vineyard De Reestlandhoeve plays classic music.

Whenever the weather conditions are bad – storms, rain, cold - , then the vines certainly have difficulty with that. The music can alleviate these external influences somewhat but can certainly not compensate for it entirely. De Reestlandhoeve is not only a Vineyard but also offers a place for people with various disabilities as a Care Farm. People of various ages with diverse issues such as a mental disability, psychiatric issues, autism, dementia and more can find a place here. The common denominator is that people enjoy contributing to the activities within De Reestlandhoeve.

Citizen Wolf Pty Ltd,"Citizen Wolf is re-engineering the way clothes are made at scale to be both custom fit and carbon negative. Distilled from 196 million data points, our proprietary Magic Fit® technology replaces the measuring tape with simple biometrics to automate the process of tailoring from home. Magic Fit® needs only your height, weight and age (plus bra for women) to create a 94% accurate mathematical model of your body which we use to create custom-fit garments faster and more accurately than a human tailor. Because we make only what we sell and send nothing to landfill, Citizen Wolf produces 48% LESS carbon than the legacy fast fashion equivalent. But we go five steps further to be truly carbon negative by offsetting five (5) kg of carbon for every one (1) kg created via Verified Carbon Standard accredited forestry projects in Tasmania. They are also proudly Ethical Clothing Australia certified, plus we’ve opted into the federal Modern Slavery Act.

Bower,"We solve the problem by putting a value on all consumer packaging. Packaging that already has a value is recycled at a much greater extent than packaging that does. The PET bottle is an excellent example. By making monetary values and discount coupons available to those who scan and recycle with the app, the effect will be the same, but for all packaging with a barcode and not just for the pet bottle. We can use the existing infrastructure and increase recycling by adding motivating elements in the form of incentives. With the Bower app, you can scan almost everything with a barcode. Once the packaging has been scanned, you are required to recycle it to actually gain access to the points, which can then be converted into money and discounts. We ensure that what is scanned is actually recycled using GPS positioning. We make it possible for companies to take active responsibility for their packaging. They can now ensure that their packaging is recycled to a greater extent by connecting their packaging and thus contributing to the financial incentives that are ultimately paid out to the user.","June, 2019","STOCKHOLM, Stockholm, Sweden",Service with Minor Environmental Footprint,www.getbower.com,82.2,12.7,28.6,15.4,25.4,

Physicians Thrive,"Justin Nabity, Founder and CEO of Physicians Thrive discovered that physicians frequently get screwed over.

His team set out to change this by providing them with a robust menu of services to support them while they make major financial and career decisions. After serving physicians for almost a decade it became clear that their primary role was to help physicians gain financial vision. Driven by a mission to do the most good possible for their clients, they decided to give back to the community by impacting physical vision and establishing a one-for-one program.

The more transparent this is in everything they do and say, the clearer they can be about the positive impacts they make. Maybe one day all businesses will run this way.

Beam Australia,"Beam Australia has broken up with the 40-hour work week. They believe employee impact should be measured on outcomes not time at a desk. Beam helps companies grow in two key ways. We unlock the most amazing, productive group of talent: part-time professionals. We also provide businesses with the tools to get flexible, increase employee wellbeing and prepare for the future of work. Why Beam: Co-Founders Stephanie Reuss and Victoria Stuart left corporate careers to start Beam because they wanted to change the conversation around part-time. It was personal. When they became mums, because of big careers, they were forced to burn out or drop out of the workforce altogether. The obvious middle ground — part-time — wasn't an option because most businesses weren't doing it well or at all. The brain drain of amazing women at this stage of life is crazy and has enormous implications for women in leadership roles, superannuation, wellbeing and more. But Beam isn't just about mums. Lots of people can't work full-time even though they're still ambitious and super productive — parents, carers, athletes, those with portfolio careers, people starting businesses… Since 2016, Beam has helped add $13 million in new roles to the economy and topped up women’s superannuation by over $800,000.","June, 2019","Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",Service with Minor Environmental Footprint,beamaustralia.com.au,81.0,9.2,25.5,21.8,13.4,10.9

Value Proposition Golden Sunland collaborates with Myanmar smallholder farmers as an aggregator, to steward and streamline the value chain, from seed, to harvest, to table. Progressive Solution Their collaboration is an inclusive model that improves yields, lowers costs and is sustainable. This improves the lives of their partner farmers and alleviates poverty within their communities.

Becoming a B Corp certifies that that both the economic and social values of our model are part of our mission and rates our effectiveness in accomplishing them. The Change We Seek In spite of unprecedented economic and demographic growth over the past several years, many developing nations are confronted with the perpetual problem of housing. Today there is a total housing deficit of over 400 million around the world. In order to cope with a flawed housing delivery system, most families construct their own homes magnifying the problem since materials are inherently expensive and financing for this segment of the market is limited. Thus, housing fails to fulfill its basic economic function of building household wealth and falls short in its social function. Echale a Tu Casa seeks to revert this vicious cycle by correcting the flaws inherent to the self-build process, thus allowing it to deliver returns on economic, social, and environmental levels. Through Echale’s innovative model, families can build their own home becoming proprietors of a patrimony that they can count on and inherit to the next generation.

He lived for 20 years in a yoga ashram, consuming little and owning less. After leaving that community, Penny worked in a mattress store and was struck by two realizations: 1) most people shop for mattresses in a state of tension and mistrust because of traditional selling practices, and 2) most conventional or foam mattresses contain toxic chemicals, particularly flame retardants and pesticides, that threaten both human and environmental health.  Penny viewed the bedroom as a key retreat from pollutant exposure, and better sleep as essential to health. In 2003, he opened his own mattress store and in 2006, founded Savvy Rest. Penny made a connection with a natural latex supplier from India, who extended him credit on the strength of a handshake and their shared outlook. Penny chose natural latex, organic wool, and organic cotton as materials for Savvy RestÕs signature mattress because they do not expose sleepers to off-gassing chemicals or pesticide residues.","March, 2013","Charlottesville, Virginia, United States",Manufacturing,www.savvyrest.com,80.1,15.1,21.5,19.9,23.6,

HLH,"Hawaiian Legacy Hardwoods (HLH) has found a way to occupy the sweet spot where “doing good” meets “doing well” by planting rare high value endemic koa trees on Hawaii Island. Some trees are planted for investors for eventual harvest, while others—“Legacy Trees”—are planted to permanently reforest the land, sequester carbon, advance science and inspire environmental awareness. The “For Harvest” model has many supporters, and for good reason. What people may not realize, however, is that the economic benefit to society by not harvesting the tree is just as compelling. Over a 50-year lifetime, one single tree generates $31,250 worth of oxygen, provides $62,000 worth of air pollution control, recycles $37,500 worth of water, and controls $31,250 worth of soil erosion. Furthermore, each tree is equipped with a proprietary state-of-the-art RFID geo-tagging system, which electronically tracks each individual tree in the forest. HLH has been actively building strategic alliances with green minded companies and associations to further the cause of the koa restoration project. With these organizations, HLH has planted more than 200,000 trees in just four short years. In addition, their Legacy Tree sponsorship program supports more than 240 charities worldwide.","June, 2013","Honolulu, Hawaii, United States",Agriculture/Growers,www.hawaiianlegacyhardwoods.com,137.8,15.9,19.7,58.6,43.6,

Thanksgiving Coffee Co.,"Thanksgiving Coffee Company began roasting coffee in 1972 in an old wooden fish-packing plant, nestled in the Noyo Harbor of Northern California. Much like a scene from SteinbeckÕs Cannery Row, rugged fishermen, artisan boat builders, cranky deck hands, and the salty aroma of a working harbor surrounded them. Their approach to coffee roasting was inspired by the bountiful landscape and a proud culture of craftsmanship. The salmon catches decreased each year and the redwood trees were logged faster than they could grow, forcing the local mill to close. Many craftspeople disappeared too, leaving unemployment and a struggling community. Thanksgiving Coffee grew up in the midst of a once vibrant, resource-rich environment. They learned about sustainability by watching the foundations of their local economy disappear. Their business model is informed by their experience; a light footprint on the planet and a heavy focus on economic justice was their response.

There are many definitions of the field, but they all share several concepts: their work includes analysis and design of buildings and other structures for real-world loads, in order to provide for safe and serviceable use. Because Old Structures works with existing buildings, their analyses often include investigation of existing conditions or failure. In fact, their standard scope of work includes an investigation phase, something that is not true of structural engineering firms in general. Old Structures Engineering is dedicated to the idea that old buildings are not only as good as new ones, but can be better because they are cultural artifacts that help inform us all of who and where they are. Preserving and reusing old buildings strengthen our common history by preserving the locations and appearance of our cities and towns, while at the same time saving energy and natural resources by reusing existing built structure rather than demolishing it and building new.","March, 2015","New York, New York, United States",Service with Minor Environmental Footprint,www.oldstructures.com,80.4,14.9,21.2,34.3,5.1,4.9

During the conversion process, the unsorted residual waste stream is reduced into many of its more basic natural components. At an almost molecular level, these natural components reconstitute themselves and bind together into a new composite material. The UBQ solution effectively enables industry to reuse wasted materials over and over again.

LUMNI CHILE,"Lumni is a new kind of financial services company dedicated to ensuring that students everywhere can leverage their most valuable asset - their own future potential - to access financing for college. Unlike traditional student lenders, they fundamentally align the interest of their investors and students in a win-win relationship that benefits everyone. Lumni's investment funds don't make loans. Instead, students commit a fixed percentage of income for the 10 years after they graduate. This dramatically reduces the risk of unmanageable payments after graduation in the case of unemployment or underemployment, giving debt-averse, underserved college students the comfort to take a leap. Lumni also employs an innovative underwriting process, determining creditworthiness not on access to co-signer like traditional lenders, but instead on a student's personal drive and potential. This allows Lumni to identify qualified clients from with the country's most underserved populations, students who would be deemed too risky by private lenders. Finally, Lumni distinguishes itself by building a relationship with its students and supporting them with career coaching and development services.","August, 2012","Santiago, Santiago, Chile",Service with Minor Environmental Footprint,lumni.net/,92.2,15.3,21.0,11.1,3.4,41.4

Runa,"Runa brews beverages from guayusa (gwhy-you-sa), an Amazonian super-leaf naturally packed with caffeinate and polyphenoal antioxidants. Guayusa, which is native to the biodiverse region where the Andes meet the Amazon, is brewed like tea and provides clear and focused energy – what the indigenous Kichwa people call “mental strength and courage.”  Runa began as a conversation over tea, during the hours before sunrise in the Amazon rainforest. Together, Runa’s founders and Kichwa communities envisioned a business that could share energizing, rich-tasting guayusa with the world – a business that would respect cultural traditions, support small farmers, and maintain the integrity of the Amazon rainforest. Runa now buys guayusa leaves from over 2,300 farming families. Those leaves are processed in a plant in Ecuador and then shipped to the U.S. where they are shared with a growing number of people. Runa is proving that businesses in the Amazon can be good for the environment and the preservation of traditional cultural practices while supporting producers and connecting them to consumers around the world.
